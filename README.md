# Book-Recommendation-System

#What does it do: 
This project aims to build a book recommendation system to help people find their next favorite book to read. Our system does not use information such as price or sellers, it purely finds what fits your current taste and recommend you what you should read next.

#Motivation: 
Nowadays, reading is still one of the major ways for entertainment. However, sometimes what prevents people from choosing to read is just they do not know how to find some valuable and attractive reading resources on the Internet. With a good recommendation system, users can find out the next book to read without having the awkward gap time. Book production companies and some electric reading companies including Amazon will also benefit from this.

#Related Work: 
There are many book recommendation services on the internet, such like Amazon’s Book Selling website, BookCrossing.com and so on. Researchers tried to use different algorithms to enhance the efficiency of their recommendation system. I think the biggest difference between our system and Amazon’s Book Selling system is that our system only recommends related books given the book you are currently interested in. Amazon website, on the other hand, will give you a lot of entries for the same book but from different sellers. Based on prices and promotions, some other books might even show up higher than the actual recommended books.
